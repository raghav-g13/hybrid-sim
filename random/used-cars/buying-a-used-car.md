What all should you do?

1. Research the model + any noted issues
    - AC issues can be simple or incredibly expensive to fix
    - 99-04(?) Camrys / 06-11(?) Accords were not reliable even though the brands/models generally are
    - Generally very very bad news: Blown gaskets, snapped timing belts/chains (esp in interference engines)
1. Get/Ask for a CarFax report (Tianrui trick)
1. VinCheck for stolen or title washing
1. How often was service done? Does the car burn oil? Catalytic converter? Accidents/thefts? Pets?
    1. Oil changes should be done every 5k miles, definitely more frequently than 10k or whatever the manufacturer says
    1. Timing belts should be replaced every 100k miles
        - Check serpentine/accessories belt
    1. Brakes?
    1. Transmission/clutch + transmission fluid change?
    1. Tires?
1. Price insurance
    - AAA offers discounts for AAA member, good student, good driver, military
    - Geico was comparable for me in the Bay Area
    - Combine Auto + Renter's
    - AAA seems to have better reviews
1. Inspecting the car yourself
    1. Colors of fluids
    1. Panel gaps and alignment
    1. Brake rotor scoring
    1. Cold start

    1. Get OBDII scanner or pass-through + relevant software
        1. Some are more general but cheaper (VXDIAG) whereas some are brand-specific (can also get cracked at your own risk)
        1. Do this before and after test-drive
1. Pre-Purchase Inspection, esp to estimate your costs - Student Discount
1. SMOG rules in CA
    - Sale
        1. Not required for sale if the car is < 4 years old
        1. Otherwise, seller must smog, but you can pay for it to reduce sales price as that is taxed + get smog coupons (may have to be printed sometimes) - Student Discount
            1. Or risk it buy buying the car super cheap
    - Routine
        - EVs are exempt
        - Gasoline
            - Car within 4 MY are exempt for first 8 years of registration - must pay smog abatement fee
            - Used cars older than 1975 MY are exempt
            - Otherwise most CA counties requires smog inspections every two years
